        <h1>Advance Happy Valentines BATAS 🌙✨</h1>
        <p class="magic">
            Since you'll be leaving before Valentine's Day, I decided to give this to you in advance. Happy Valentine's 🌹
        </p>
        <p class="magic">
            I just wanted to say that I really enjoy talking to you these past few weeks and I hope there's something special growing between us. I hope this doesn't make things awkward or make you disappear on me, right?
        </p>
        <p class="magic">
            Lately, life has felt a bit more exciting and meaningful. I've been more motivated, taking more risks, even more motivated to code (especially in C, of course). And honestly, you're part of that reason.
        </p>
        <p class="magic">
           I find you adorable not just outwardly, but also who you are from within. I really feel like we genuinely connect, and I hope you receive this message well and the way I intended to: sincere and respectful.
        </p>
        <p class="magic">
            I actually have a lot more I want to say… but I think it would be better if I tell you in person.
        </p>
        <p class="magic">
            Sincerely,<br>
            [Relentless And Lifetime Peculiar Hopeful me]<br>
            <em>hint: caps shall set you free</em>
